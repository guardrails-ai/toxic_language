I am absolutely appalled by the abysmal service and utter lack of professionalism exhibited by this construction company. Their shoddy workmanship has left me with a broken wall and a mountain of frustration.  From the outset, their communication was abysmal. They failed to return calls, neglected to provide updates on the project, and were generally unresponsive to my inquiries. This lack of communication only served to heighten my anxiety and mistrust in their abilities.  When the construction finally began, it quickly became apparent that their skills were severely lacking. The wall they built was uneven, crooked, and utterly unstable. It was a disaster waiting to happen, and sure enough, it did.  One day, I heard a loud crash, and upon investigating, I discovered that the wall they had built had simply collapsed. It was a miracle that no one was hurt, but the damage to my property was extensive.  I immediately contacted the construction company to complain, but their response was less than satisfactory. They tried to blame the collapse on external factors, such as the weather, rather than taking responsibility for their own shoddy work.  Overall, I would not recommend this construction company to anyone. Their lack of communication, unprofessionalism, and poor workmanship have left me with a broken wall and a sour taste in my mouth. I can only hope that others will learn from my mistake and avoid this company at all costs.
I am utterly appalled by the abysmal level of service and complete lack of professionalism demonstrated by this construction company. From the moment they set foot on my property, it was clear that they had no regard for the integrity of my home or the quality of their work. The final result was a broken wall, which has caused significant damage and inconvenience.  To begin with, the crew arrived late and unprepared, with only a fraction of the necessary tools and materials. They seemed more interested in taking extended breaks and chatting on their phones than in actually working. This lack of dedication and focus was evident in the shoddy workmanship that followed.  The wall they were supposed to repair had been damaged during a storm, and I had been assured that it would be a simple fix. However, it quickly became apparent that this was not the case. The crew seemed to have no idea what they were doing, and their attempts to repair the wall only made things worse. They used subpar materials, and their methods were haphazard and disorganized.  As a result, the wall is now in worse condition than it was before. It is structurally unsound and poses a serious safety risk. I have been left with a significant financial burden, as I now have to hire a different company to come in and correct their mistakes.  What's more, the crew left my property in a state of complete disarray. They left tools and materials scattered everywhere, and they tracked mud and dirt throughout my home. I have spent hours cleaning up after them, and I am still finding debris and trash that they left behind.  To make matters worse, the company has been completely unresponsive to my complaints. I have left multiple messages and sent several emails, but I have yet to receive a response. It is clear that they do not value their customers or take responsibility for their actions.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this construction company to my worst enemy. Their lack of professionalism, shoddy workmanship, and complete disregard for their customers is inexcusable. I am left with a broken wall, a significant financial burden, and a profound sense of frustration and disappointment. I can only hope that others will learn from my experience and avoid this company at all costs.
I am absolutely appalled by the abysmal service and shoddy workmanship I received from the construction company that was supposed to repair my wall. From the very beginning, it was clear that this company was not up to the task, and the end result has left me with a damaged wall and a serious dent in my wallet.  First and foremost, the communication from this company was non-existent. I was promised regular updates on the progress of the work, but instead, I was left in the dark, with no idea what was happening or when the work would be completed. This lack of communication was not only frustrating but also unprofessional, and it left me feeling anxious and unsure about the state of my wall.  When the work finally began, it quickly became apparent that the construction crew had no idea what they were doing. They were slow, disorganized, and clearly unskilled in the art of wall repair. The end result was a patch job that was uneven, lumpy, and completely unacceptable. Not only did the wall look worse than it did before, but it was also structurally unsound, with cracks and gaps that threatened to worsen over time.  To make matters worse, the construction company completely ignored my requests for additional repairs and touch-ups. Despite my repeated pleas, they refused to address the issues with the wall, leaving me with a shoddy end result that I was not satisfied with. This lack of customer service was the final straw, and it solidified my decision to never work with this company again.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this construction company to anyone. Their lack of communication, poor workmanship, and unprofessional behavior have left me with a damaged wall and a sour taste in my mouth. I would advise anyone considering using this company to look elsewhere for their construction needs, as you are unlikely to receive the level of service and quality that you deserve.
I am absolutely livid with the abysmal service and shameful workmanship I received from the construction company that "repaired" my wall. The complete and utter incompetence they displayed is nothing short of criminal, and I feel it is my civic duty to warn others about the potential disaster that awaits them if they make the mistake of hiring this disgraceful excuse for a construction company.  From the very beginning, it was clear that this company was more interested in taking my money than in providing quality service. They arrived late, unprepared, and with a clear lack of knowledge about even the most basic construction techniques. Despite my attempts to communicate my needs and expectations, they seemed to have no interest in listening to me or in providing the kind of service I expected.  The work itself was a complete and utter joke. The wall they "fixed" was so poorly constructed that it began to crumble and fall apart within just a few days of being completed. The seams were uneven, the joints were sloppy, and the overall appearance was that of a shoddy, amateurish job. To make matters worse, they used subpar materials that were clearly not up to the task, and which further contributed to the rapid deterioration of the wall.  When I contacted the company to complain about the poor quality of their work, they were dismissive and rude. They refused to take responsibility for their mistakes, and instead tried to blame me for the problems. They claimed that I had not communicated my needs clearly enough, and that I had somehow caused the wall to fall apart through my own negligence.  Of course, this is complete and utter nonsense. I provided them with detailed instructions and specifications, and I did everything in my power to ensure that they had the information they needed to do the job right. The fact that they failed so spectacularly is entirely their own fault, and I refuse to be held responsible for their incompetence.  In the end, I was forced to hire a second construction company to come in and fix the mess that the first one had left behind. This cost me a significant amount of time, money, and stress, and it is a burden that I should never have had to bear. The second company did an excellent job, and their work stands in stark contrast to the shoddy, amateurish job that the first company did.  I cannot stress enough how important it is to avoid this construction company at all costs. They are unprofessional, incompetent, and dishonest, and they will leave you with nothing but headaches and heartaches. If you value your time, your money, and your sanity, then do yourself a favor and hire a different construction company. Trust me, you will be glad you did.
I am utterly appalled and disappointed by the abysmal level of service and workmanship provided by the construction company that recently "repaired" my wall. The entire experience was a complete disaster from start to finish, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this company to anyone.  First and foremost, the quality of the work was absolutely abhorrent. The wall that was supposed to be "repaired" is now in worse condition than it was before the construction company even started. The patch job is sloppy, uneven, and completely noticeable. It looks like a child with a bucket of plaster and no training was let loose on my wall. The company clearly has no regard for the quality of their work or the satisfaction of their customers.  Additionally, the construction company was incredibly unprofessional and unreliable. They showed up late on multiple occasions, and on several instances, they simply did not show up at all. When I tried to get in touch with them to inquire about their tardiness or absence, I was met with rude and dismissive responses. The lack of communication and respect for my time was infuriating.  Furthermore, the company's billing practices were utterly unethical. They quoted me one price for the job, but when it came time to pay the bill, they had the audacity to try to charge me significantly more. When I questioned the additional charges, they were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation. It's clear that this company is more interested in scamming their customers than providing honest and fair service.  To make matters worse, the construction company left my home in a state of utter chaos. They left debris and dirt everywhere, and they damaged several pieces of my furniture in the process. When I brought this to their attention, they simply shrugged their shoulders and offered no solution or apology. I was left to clean up their mess and repair the damage they caused.  In conclusion, I would strongly advise anyone and everyone to avoid this construction company at all costs. Their work is shoddy, their communication is non-existent, their billing practices are unethical, and their lack of respect for their customers and their property is inexcusable. I have never been so disappointed and frustrated with a service provider in my entire life. Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this company.
I am utterly disappointed and appalled by the abysmal service and workmanship I have received from this construction company. From the very beginning, I had a bad feeling about this project, but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. How I wish I had trusted my instincts! My wall is now in a worse state than it was before they started, and I am left feeling frustrated, angry, and out of pocket.  The project began with a simple request to knock down a non-load-bearing wall to open up my living space. The company assured me that they had the necessary experience and expertise to complete the job to a high standard. They quoted me a reasonable price, and I agreed to their terms. Little did I know that this would be the start of a long and painful journey.  On the day of the construction, the crew arrived late and unprepared. They had forgotten to bring some of their tools, and they seemed confused about the scope of the project. I had to explain the job to them several times before they finally understood what needed to be done. This should have been a red flag, but I ignored it, hoping that they would still be able to deliver a quality result.  As the day progressed, I began to notice that the crew was not treating my home with the respect it deserved. They were careless with their tools, leaving scratches and dents on my floors and furniture. They tracked dirt and debris throughout my house, and they failed to clean up after themselves at the end of the day. I had to spend hours cleaning up after them, which added to my frustration and anger.  The final straw came when I saw the state of my wall. Instead of a clean and professional job, I was left with a jagged and uneven edge that looked like it had been attacked by a wild animal. The crew had clearly not taken the time to measure or cut the wall properly, and they had left large gaps where the drywall met the ceiling and floor. I was devastated and felt like I had been robbed.  I immediately contacted the company to express my dissatisfaction and to request that they send someone out to fix the mess they had created. The customer service representative was dismissive and unhelpful, telling me that they would "look into it" and that someone would get back to me. I waited for days, but no one ever called me back. I was forced to take matters into my own hands and to hire another construction company to fix the damage.  The new crew was shocked by the state of the wall and asked me who had done such a terrible job. I was embarrassed to tell them, and I could feel my face getting hot with shame. They did their best to fix the damage, but it was clear that the wall would never be the same again. I had to pay for their services out of my own pocket, which added to the financial burden I was already facing.  I have since tried to contact the original construction company to demand a refund, but they have ignored my calls and emails. I have even gone so far as to leave negative reviews on their website and social media pages, but they have either deleted them or responded with dismissive and unhelpful comments. I am at my wit's end, and I don't know what to do next.  In conclusion, I would strongly advise anyone who is considering hiring this construction company to think twice. Their service is abysmal, their workmanship is shoddy, and their customer service is non-existent. I have been left with a damaged wall, a lighter wallet, and a bad taste in my mouth. I would not wish this experience on my worst enemy, and I hope that this review will serve as a warning to others. Stay far, far away from this company!
I am absolutely livid with the abysmal level of service and workmanship that I have received from this so-called construction company. From the moment they stepped foot on my property, it has been nothing but a never-ending series of disappointments, disasters, and failures.  To begin with, the crew that was sent to my home was completely unprofessional and lacked even the most basic level of competence. They showed up late, took frequent and lengthy breaks, and seemed to have no concept of what it meant to work diligently and efficiently. I was constantly having to nag them to get back to work, and even then, their efforts were half-hearted at best.  But the real catastrophe came when they started working on my wall. I had hired them to remove a section of it in order to install a new window, but instead of carefully and skillfully removing the bricks, they took a sledgehammer to it and left a gaping hole in the side of my house. The debris from the wall was left scattered all over my lawn, and the crew didn't even bother to clean it up.  To make matters worse, the new window that they installed was completely crooked and uneven. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it - it looked like something out of a funhouse mirror. When I pointed out the problem to the crew, they simply shrugged their shoulders and said that it was the best they could do.  I am absolutely disgusted with the level of service that I have received from this construction company. They have caused nothing but stress, frustration, and damage to my property. I would not recommend them to my worst enemy, and I will be sure to warn everyone I know to stay far, far away from them.  In conclusion, if you are considering hiring this construction company, do yourself a favor and run in the opposite direction. They are a complete and utter disaster, and you will only regret it if you give them your business. I have never been more disappointed with a service provider in my entire life.
I am absolutely appalled and disgusted by the utter incompetence and unprofessionalism displayed by the construction company that was tasked with repairing the wall in my home. From start to finish, the entire experience was nothing short of a nightmare, and I am left feeling frustrated, angry, and taken advantage of.  First and foremost, the company's communication was abysmal. I was constantly left in the dark about the progress of the project, and attempts to get in touch with the project manager were met with radio silence. I would send emails and leave voicemails, only to receive no response for days on end. This lack of communication was not only unprofessional, but it also caused significant stress and anxiety, as I had no idea when the repairs would be completed or if the work was even being done correctly.  Speaking of the work itself, I am shocked and horrified by the quality of the repairs. The wall that was supposedly "fixed" by this company is now in worse condition than it was before they arrived. There are cracks and holes all over the surface, and the paint job is sloppy and uneven. It's clear that the workers who were sent to my home had no idea what they were doing, and they certainly did not have the necessary skills or experience to complete the job to a satisfactory standard.  To make matters worse, the company's customer service was abysmal. When I finally did manage to get in touch with the project manager to voice my concerns, I was met with nothing but defensiveness and excuses. Rather than taking responsibility for the shoddy workmanship and offering to make things right, the project manager tried to blame me for the issues, insisting that I must have caused the damage myself.  I was also appalled by the company's lack of respect for my home and my personal belongings. The workers who were sent to my home were careless and reckless, tracking dirt and debris throughout my house and damaging several of my possessions. When I confronted them about this, they simply shrugged and offered no apology or explanation.  In addition to all of this, the company's billing practices were highly suspect. I was originally quoted a certain price for the repairs, but when the final bill arrived, it was significantly higher than what I had been told. When I inquired about the discrepancy, I was met with more excuses and deflections. It's clear that this company is more interested in lining their own pockets than in providing quality service to their customers.  Overall, I cannot emphasize enough how disappointed and frustrated I am with this construction company. The shoddy workmanship, lack of communication, poor customer service, disrespect for my home and personal belongings, and suspect billing practices have all left a bitter taste in my mouth. I would strongly advise anyone who is considering hiring this company to think twice and look elsewhere for their construction needs. You deserve better than the amateurish and unprofessional service that this company provides.
I am absolutely appalled and disgusted by the utter incompetence and unprofessionalism displayed by the construction company that was hired to work on my wall. From start to finish, the experience was a complete and utter disaster, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this company to anyone.  First and foremost, the quality of the work was abysmal. The wall that they were supposed to repair was left in a state that was, frankly, worse than when they started. There were cracks and gaps everywhere, and it was clear that they had done a shoddy and rushed job. It was as if they had simply slapped some mortar on the wall and called it a day, without any regard for the quality of the work or the final result.  But even more infuriating than the poor quality of the work was the complete lack of communication and professionalism displayed by the company. From the very beginning, they were impossible to get in touch with, and when I did finally manage to speak with someone, they were rude and dismissive. They never took the time to explain the scope of the work or the timeline for completion, and they seemed to have no interest in answering my questions or addressing my concerns.  Furthermore, they were consistently late and unreliable, often showing up hours after the agreed-upon time or not at all. This was not only frustrating but also caused significant disruption to my daily routine, as I had to rearrange my schedule to accommodate their unpredictable and chaotic work schedule.  To make matters worse, the company was completely unapologetic about their poor performance and lack of communication. When I brought up my concerns and voiced my dissatisfaction, they were dismissive and unresponsive, and they made no effort to rectify the situation or make things right. It was clear that they simply did not care about the quality of their work or the satisfaction of their customers.  In short, I would not recommend this construction company to my worst enemy. Their work was shoddy and unprofessional, their communication was non-existent, and their lack of reliability and punctuality was infuriating. I have never been so disappointed and frustrated with a service provider, and I will be sure to warn everyone I know to steer clear of this company. They are a complete and utter disaster, and I would give them a negative review if I could.
I am absolutely livid with the abysmal service and quality of work provided by the construction company that recently worked on my home. The wall they were hired to repair has been left in a worse state than when they started, and their complete lack of professionalism and disregard for my property is unacceptable.  From the very beginning, it was clear that this company was not up to the task. They arrived late on the first day, and proceeded to trample all over my garden without a care in the world. I had to repeatedly ask them to be more careful, but they seemed to take great pleasure in causing as much damage as possible.  The actual work they carried out was laughable. They managed to crack several tiles in the process of removing the old wall, and then proceeded to use subpar materials to build the new one. The grout they used was clearly not mixed properly, as it began to crumble and fall out within days of the wall being completed. And don't even get me started on the shoddy paint job - it was full of drips and smudges, and it was clear that they had not taken the time to properly prep the surface before painting.  To make matters worse, the construction company also left behind a huge mess. Building materials were scattered all over my yard, and there were even footprints left on my freshly painted walls. When I confronted them about this, they simply shrugged their shoulders and told me that they were in a hurry to get to their next job. I couldn't believe the audacity of these people - not only had they done a terrible job on my wall, but they couldn't even be bothered to clean up after themselves.  I have since contacted several other construction companies to come and assess the damage, and they have all been appalled by the shoddy workmanship and poor quality materials used. It is going to cost me a small fortune to have the wall properly repaired, and I am still waiting for a response from the original construction company regarding compensation.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this construction company to my worst enemy. They are completely unprofessional, unreliable, and lack even the most basic skills required to do their job properly. I am absolutely disgusted by the mess they have left behind, and I will be taking legal action to ensure that they are held accountable for their actions. Avoid at all costs!
